I work at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at Jiangnan University, located at a beautiful city, Wuxi, China. I am also a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Pattern Recognition and Computational Intelligence.

I received my B.Sc. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Nanjing University in June 2014. I was a Ph.D. candidate at [IIP](http://iip.nju.edu.cn/) group in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University, led by professor Jun-Yuan Xie and Chong-Jun Wang, and received my Ph.D. degree in June 2019. I was also one of the members of the international branches of Hasso-Plattner-Institut from Germany (2016-2019). I started my postdoc in Jiangnan University from 2020 supervised by professor Xiao-jun Wu, majoring multi-modal data analysis.

My research interest includes Multi-modal Data Mining and Natural Language Processing, such as backdoor attack, cross-modal retrieval, few-shot learning, fine-grained sentimental analysis, short text mining in online social media, etc. If interested, feel free to email me.
