Heng-yang Lu received his B.Sc. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Nanjing University in June 2014. He was a Ph.D. candidate at IIP group in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University, led by professor Jun-Yuan Xie and Chong-Jun Wang. He received his Ph.D. degree in June 2019. He was also one of the members of the international branches of Hasso-Plattner-Institut from Germany (2016-2019). He started his postdoc in Jiangnan University from 2020, majoring multi-modal data analysis.

Currently, he is the Associate Professor in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China. He is also a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Engineering Laboratory of Pattern Recognition and Computational Intelligence.

His research interest includes Multi-modal Data Mining and Natural Language Processing, such as backdoor attack, cross-modal retrieval, few-shot learning, fine-grained sentimental analysis, short text mining in online social media, etc.
